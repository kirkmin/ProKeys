			<h2>Welcome to Prokeys!</h2>
			<p>ProKeys is a music app that enables your computer keyboard to play like a musical keyboard. You probably figured that this app would be most effective when used with a computer keyboard. Not all keyboards are created equal, though: Most keyboards are not able to register many combinations of keys at once or even register keys were never pressed; therefore, I recommend using a NKRO, anti-ghosting keyboard, like I'm doing in my videos, for the best experience on ProKeys. I also recommend using Chrome as your browser, since it deploys the crucial mp3 assets smoothly and probably presents the least bugs.</p>

			<h2>Playing on the Front Page...</h2>
			<p>I have already set the default keyset on the Front page to be able to play the piece River Flows in You by Yiruma. Each of the four left columns play a simple chord: Pressing Q,A,Z plays the D chord; W,S,X the E chord; E,D,C the F sharp minor; and R,F,V the A. The melody is a bit more complicated. The notes are usually set in an ascending order from left to right, and also from bottom to top. Most of the verses are played in the middle row while the choruses in the top row. Below is a video of myself attempting to play. It’s not perfect, but it may help you figure the song out. Have fun and good luck!</p>

			<h2>Customizing your own Keysets</h2>
			<p>The next step on ProKeys is to set up your own keyset! After logging into your account, go to the customize page. There you can choose to create or edit your own keysets. You’ll see a keyboard and a piano, each with a side scrolling functionality as needed. You can hover your mouse over the keyboard and see that the keys are blank, meaning that none of them have a note assigned to them yet. To assign them, simply drag and drop the piano notes on top of the keyboard. You can click the key on either the piano or keyboard to hear its note. Also, you can simply hold the “shift” key to see the notes assigned to the keyboard all at once. That should be enough to get you started. Don’t forget to save!</p>

			<h2>Recording your stuff!</h2>
			<p>After creating some keysets, you will be able to record what you play! Simply click the "record" link on the right side of the navigation. You should see a dark-red, circular button. If you click it it should turn brighter with a pulsing animation. It means that it started to listen to what you are playing! Play some stuff and save what you have recorded. You may want to turn off the red button before saving for a tighter recording. You can even listen to what you are about to save by pressing the "play" button. After you save, your recording should show up under Your Recordings section in your Account from which you can enjoy your musical creation!
